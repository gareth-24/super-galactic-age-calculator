## Description

_This is a basic application that allows users to input their age to see their age in other planet's years.  Additionally, there is JavaScript logic that can calculate the number of specific "planet-years" that have passed since a past birthday, or how far away a future birthday is. This project was completed as an independent code review for week 5 of Epicodus to demonstrate and understanding of red-green TDD with Jest, ES6 classes, and managing dependencies with webpack._
